# CampSite-App


## Introduction
I worked with a team of other developers to create a collection of web applications using the agile scrum methodology. I built an application utilizing python and the Django framework that allows users to add campsites they have visited to a database, search the database for campsites, and rate campsites. I used beautiful soup to scrape the national forest website to add all national forest campsites to the database, and connected to the National Parks API so that users are able to search for campsites at all national parks through my CampSite app.
